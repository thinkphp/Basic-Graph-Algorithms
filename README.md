### Outline

1. Graphs
2. Why Study Graphs
3. Storing Graphs
4. Traversals
5. Topological Sort


   An abstract way of representing connectivity using nodes (also called vertices) and edges.
   We will label the nodes from 1 to n.
   m edges connect some pairs of nodes. Edges can be either one-directional or bidirectional.
   Nodes and Edges can have some auxiliary information.
  
  
   Lots of problemes and formulated in terms of Graphs
   - Shortest path problems.
   - Network flow problemes.
   - Matching problemes.
   - 2-SAT problem.
   - Graph coloring problem.
   - Traveling salesman problem ( still unsolved)
   - and many more.
